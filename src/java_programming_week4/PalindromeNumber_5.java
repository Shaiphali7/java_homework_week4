/**
 * 5. Palindrome Number
 * Write a method called isPalindrome with one int parameter called number.
 * The method needs to return a boolean.
 * It should return true if the number is a palindrome number otherwise it should return false.
 * Check the tips below for more info about palindromes.
 * Example Input/Output
 * isPalindrome(-1221); → should return true
 * isPalindrome(707); → should return true
 * isPalindrome(11212); → should return false because the reverse is 21211 and that is not equal to
 * 11212.
 * Tip: What is a Palindrome number? A palindrome number is a number which when reversed is equal
 * to the original number. For example: 121, 12321, and 1001 etc.
 * Tip: Logic to check a palindrome number
 * Find the reverse of the given number. Store it in some variable, say reverse. Compare the number
 * with the reverse.
 * If both are the same then the number is a palindrome otherwise it is not.
 * Tip: Logic to reverse a number
 * Declare and initialize another variable to store the reverse of a number, for example reverse = 0.
 * Extract the last digit of the given number by performing the modulo division (remainder).
 * Store the last digit to some variable say lastDigit = num % 10.
 * Increase the place value of reverse by one.
 * To increase place value multiply the reverse variable by 10 e.g. reverse = reverse * 10.
 * Add lastDigit to reverse.
 * Since the last digit of the number is processed, remove the last digit of num. To remove the last digit
 * divide number by 10.
 * Repeat steps until the number is not equal to (or greater than) zero.
 * A while loop would be good for this coding exercise.
 * Tip: Be careful with negative numbers. They can also be palindrome numbers.
 * Tip: Be careful with reversing a number, you will need a parameter for comparing a reversed number
 * with the starting number (parameter).
 * NOTE: The method isPalindrome needs to be defined as public static
